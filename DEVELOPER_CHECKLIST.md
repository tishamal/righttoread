## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Current Limitations
1. **No Authentication Yet**
   - Status: TODO
   - Workaround: Uses any email/password in demo mode
   - Fix: Implement JWT authentication

2. **Sample Data Fallback**
   - Status: By Design
   - Purpose: Graceful degradation
   - Note: Will use real data when API working

3. **No Real SSML/Audio**
   - Status: TODO (Backend feature)
   - Current: Mock audio URLs
   - Fix: Configure AWS S3 bucket and generate actual audio

4. **No Pagination**
   - Status: TODO
   - Impact: Large datasets may load slowly
   - Fix: Add pagination to all list endpoints

---

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: API Connection Refused
```bash
# Solution
cd backend
npm run dev  # Start backend server
```

### Problem: Books not loading
```bash
# Check 1: Backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/books

# Check 2: API URL in .env.local
cat .env.local

# Check 3: Database has data
psql postgresql://user@localhost/right_to_read -c "SELECT * FROM books"
```

### Problem: TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Solution
npm run build  # Check all errors
# Fix each error reported
```

### Problem: Database not found
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize schema
cd backend
npm run init-db
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found after deployment:

1. **Frontend Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous build
   git revert <commit>
   npm run build
   # Redeploy
   ```

2. **Backend Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert database schema
   # Restore from backup
   # Redeploy previous version
   ```

3. **Database Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   # Verify data integrity
   # Notify users of downtime
   ```
